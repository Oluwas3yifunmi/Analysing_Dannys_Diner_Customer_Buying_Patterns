## INTRODUCTION 
Danny just became an entrepreneur, he has been a lover of Japanese foods and at the beginning of 2021, he decides on opening his first Japanese restaurant. He decided to just serve his 3 favourite dishes which are; Sushi, Curry and Ramen. To help keep his restaurant afloat, he has employed my services as a data analyst to help analyse some of the basic patterns of his customers to help expand his business. 
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To be a successful entrepreneur, Danny has decided he wants to create a deeper connection with his customer which will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience to his customers. He is currently running an existing customer loyalty program and he came up with some questions to help him decide if he should expand this loyalty program. To help Danny's diner understands its customer preferences and patterns and also give them an insight on what to improve on to better customer experience, the following were considered;
1. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
2. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
3. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
4. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
5. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
